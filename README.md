# DadsHouse-
Here, I will learn to write code in Python to create a family website.
When I was young, I had a desire to build a personal website. However, various reasons prevented me from fulfilling this wish. Now, in my twilight years, I have more free time, and I plan to learn computer programming languages myself to create a family website where I can document the little moments of everyday life.
Thank you for stopping by, and I would appreciate any advice you have to offer.
